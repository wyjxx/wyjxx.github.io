Man-made objects:\n- A large statue/sculpture that appears to be made of stone or concrete\n- The statue shows what looks like a bear (or large mammal) eating from or drinking from a tree trunk\n- The statue is on a pedestal/base\n- Behind the statue, there's a white building with classical European architecture\n- The building has multiple floors with regular window patterns\n- There are some signs or text visible on buildings in the background, but they're not clearly readable in this lighting\n- The lighting appears to be nighttime with artificial illumination on the statue\n- The architectural style of the building looks European"

It appears to show a bear, which immediately makes me think of locations that have bears as symbols. Bears are particularly associated with:\n- Berlin, Germany (the Berlin Bear)\n- Bern, Switzerland \n- Some Russian cities\n- Some North American locations"
