Man-made objects:  \n   - The soldiers’ distinctive uniform: a beige tunic pleated kilt (“foustanella”), red fez with long black tassel, white stockings, and pom-pomed leather shoes (“tsarouchia”). This is the traditional dress of the Greek Presidential Guard, known as the Evzones.  \n   - They carry rifles with fixed bayonets and perform a highly stylized, ceremonial march.  \n   - Behind them is a low marble wall inscribed in Greek letters, listing historic battles and regions (e.g. “ΚΡΗΤΗ,” “ΑΙΓΑΙΟΝ ΙΟΝΙΟΝ”), and a guardhouse painted white with blue trim."

Contextual inference:  \n   - The Greek Evzones exclusively guard two monuments: the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Μνημείο Αγνώστου Στρατιώτη) in front of the Hellenic Parliament on Syntagma Square, and the Presidential Mansion on Leof. Vasilissis Olgas (though the latter’s guardhouse is dark red/white).  \n   - The white-and-blue striped guardhouse and the carved marble war-memorial inscriptions are specific to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Parliament building."
