There’s an A62 spur that links to Athens International Airport. The overhead sign is directing to exit Y2 for Papagou Road. This exit is likely near Marousi or the Papagou suburb, possibly close to the Alpine or Acharnes tunnels. Time to search for more details!"

    "content": "I'm reviewing details about the Motorway 64 article. At km 2.0, there's the Υ2 Papagou exit, and the tunnel lengths are 120m eastbound and 96m westbound. The photo likely shows the Papagou tunnel, with the overhead sign positioned beyond the tunnel interior. It appears to be a cut-and-cover tunnel on Attiki Odos. The M1 sign indicates proximity, likely a meter marker. To clarify, the location is underneath the Papagou tunnel at the A6/A62 junction, specifically at exit Y2 Papagou."

    "title": "Clarifying the Location",  
    "content": "The location is the Attiki Odos A6/A62 interchange tunnel at exit Y2 Papagou. However, it seems the question expects a neighborhood name, which is Papagou, part of the municipality of Papagou-Cholargos in the Athens Metro Area, Attica, Greece. There may also be tunnels on the Ymittos Ring Road named after Papagou, but I believe the exit specifically leads to Papagou neighborhood. To summarize, the best answer might be: \"Papagou, Athens, Greece, Europe,\" while also noting the \"Anastaseos Street exit on Attiki Odos.\""

    "title": "Finalizing the Location",  
    "content": "The motorway exit list is on the Motorway 64 page, so I’ll cite the source for \"Motorway 64 (Greece).\" Additionally, I need to reference the Galen page that mentions taking the Υ2 PAPAGOU exit onto Anastaseos Street. My conclusion will be that the location is: Papagou, Athens, Greece, Europe. While it may be worth mentioning Attiki Odos, I think the user will be perfectly fine with just \"Papagou, Athens, Greece, Europe\" as the final answer.Let’s walk through the key clues:\n\n1. Language and typography  \n   - Signs are in Greek and English, using “Εξοδος Y2” / “Exit Y2” and place names transliterated (e.g. “Anastaseos Street”), matching Greece’s bilingual motorway signage conventions.  \n\n2. Motorway numbering and destinations  \n   - The overhead signage shows arrows to “A62” (airport/Markopoulo) and straight-on to “Α6” towards Elefsina, while the right-hand exit is marked “Y2 Papagou – Anastaseos Street 550 m.”  \n   - A6 is the western/eastern Attiki Odos ring road around Athens; A62 is its airport spur. Exit code Y2 on this network is the Papagou exit via Odos Anastaseos. ([iiab.me](https://iiab.me/kiwix/content/wikipedia_en_all_maxi_2023-10/A/Motorway_64_%28Greece%29?utm_source=openai))\n\n3. Tunnel structure and lighting  \n   - The curved tunnel lining with overhead luminaires and variable message panels is characteristic of the cut-and-cover tunnels on the Attiki Odos Ymittos (Hymettus) branch.  \n   - According to engineering sources, the Papagou Tunnel spans roughly 100 m and immediately transitions to the Y2 exit ramp. ([iiab.me](https://iiab.me/kiwix/content/wikipedia_en_all_maxi_2023-10/A/Motorway_64_%28Greece%29?utm_source=openai))\n\n4. Local road names  \n   - “Odos Anastaseos” leads directly into the Papagou suburb of Athens, as confirmed by local directions: take Υ2 Papagou exit onto Anastaseos, then right onto Mesogeion Avenue to reach Holargos/Papagou landmarks. ([galinos-psy.gr](https://galinos-psy.gr/en/contact-us/?utm_source=openai))\n\nPutting these together, this photograph was taken from inside the Papagou Tunnel on the Attiki Odos motorway (A6/A62) just before the Y2 Papagou exit onto Anastaseos Street, placing it within the Papagou neighborhood of Athens.\n\n**Location Conclusion** Papagou, Athens, Greece, Europe"
