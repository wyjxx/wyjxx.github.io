    "title": "**2. Re-evaluating the image**",
    "content": "I'm now refining my analysis. The shadows appear more easterly than first thought, which shifts the sun's position. This subtle detail necessitates a re-evaluation of the buildings' orientation, which affects the precise location and direction."

    "title": "**2. Confirming the Location**",
    "content": "I've determined the building, confirmed by user photos and satellite data. Building 75 at Boeselagerstraße in Münster matches the image perfectly. My focus is now refining the precise angle and direction of the photograph, based on sun position and path alignment."

  {
    "title": "**3. Refining the location**",
    "content": "Now that I've confirmed the complex, I am carefully analyzing the photo. The angle suggests the photographer stood on a path, looking northeast, towards building 75. The exact position, and the presence of the tree, are key."

    "title": "**1. Synthesizing the specifics**",
    "content": "I'm now integrating all the data to fine-tune the exact position. Based on the building, the path's course, and the angle, I've zeroed in on the path running alongside building 75 at Boeselagerstraße. The direction is northeast."

    "title": "**4. Refining the specifics**",
    "content": "I'm homing in on the critical details now. The angle suggests a path running north-northeast, next to the building. Based on the shadow direction, I believe the specific photo was taken on the east side of Boeselagerstraße 75."

    "title": "**5. Refining the details**",
    "content": "I'm zeroing in on the photographic specifics. The angle is critical, and I'm measuring it again. The sun's angle and the shadow's direction place the photographer's position on the path east of building 75, and that is facing northeast.\n\nBoeselagerstraße, Münster, Germany, Europe"
