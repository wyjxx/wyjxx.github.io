    "content": "I’m noticing that there are many “Pro-Cathedral” churches around the world, but this one has a distinct Greek Revival hexastyle Doric portico with three sculptures. When I check the Wikipedia page, the image matches this facade exactly. I see the Doric columns, but I have to wonder about the ornate capitals—do they really appear Doric? The statues on the pediment seem like there should be three, but I only see one clearly in my angle. It might just be hidden. Also, I spotted a taxi with a FreeNow sign, indicating this is in Dublin."

It’s important to have this information clear, so let’s find out!"

    "content": "I've confirmed the building is St Mary's Pro-Cathedral, located at 83 Marlborough Street, Dublin 1, Ireland. It’s in the North Inner City area, specifically on Marlborough Street between Cathedral Street and Sackville Street (O'Connell Street). Notably, this region fits the \"north-of-the-Liffey\" category, which Lonely Planet mentions. For clarity, I'll refer to it as \"Marlborough Street, North Inner City, Dublin 1.\" Also, I’m noticing Greek Doric and Neoclassical influences in the architectural style."

    "content": "It seems the Luas tram doesn't run on Marlborough Street, but I can see tracks that suggest it might be nearby on O'Connell Street. The overhead wires I noticed make sense for trams, and a cable draped in the image could indeed be a tram wire. There's ongoing construction and people queuing to enter the cathedral, which adds context.\n\nI'm feeling confident about the location being Marlborough Street, North Inner City, Dublin 1, and I’ll reference Wikipedia for the address."

    "content": "I’ll cite the FreeNow site to confirm that FreeNow operates taxis in Dublin. I should also reference Wikipedia for identifying the Pro-Cathedral and use the Archdiocese site for the address.\n\nSo, my citations will be:\n\n- Pro-Cathedral identification: Wikipedia\n- Address: Archdiocese site\n- Taxi brand: FreeNow page  \n\nNow, my final answer for the location is: **Marlborough Street, North Inner City, Dublin 1, Dublin, Ireland, Europe.** This is how I’ll present it!Let’s piece together the key clues:\n\n1. Neoclassical portico  \n   - The six fluted Doric columns rising directly from the stylobate, the full‐span triangular pediment surmounted by statues, and the granite ashlar construction all match the Greek-revival façade of St Mary’s Pro-Cathedral on Marlborough Street in Dublin ([buildingsofireland.ie](https://www.buildingsofireland.ie/buildings-search/building/50010228/saint-marys-pro-cathedral-dublin-city?utm_source=openai), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary%27s_Pro-Cathedral?utm_source=openai)).\n\n2. “FreeNow” taxi livery  \n   - FreeNow is a major taxi-hailing service operating in Dublin, and the distinct white Prius with green “TAXI” and red “FreeNow” markings corresponds exactly to taxis in that city ([free-now.com](https://www.free-now.com/ie/ride/taxi-dublin/?utm_source=openai)).\n\n3. Tram tracks and overhead wiring  \n   - The visible tram rails and overhead line are consistent with Dublin’s LUAS network running along O’Connell and nearby streets on the north side of the Liffey.\n\n4. Street layout and signage  \n   - The traffic-signal design, curb detailing, and typical Irish wet weather scene (umbrellas, grey sky) further situate this on Dublin’s North Inner City streets.\n\nAll evidence converges on the pro-cathedral’s location:\n\n**Location Conclusion** 83 Marlborough Street, North Inner City (Dublin 1), Dublin, Ireland, Europe"
