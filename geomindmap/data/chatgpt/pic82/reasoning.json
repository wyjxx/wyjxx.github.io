    "content": "1. The sign reads “LOGIC LANE” in the characteristic dark-blue-and-white style used on many Oxford street‐name plates.  \n2. The building masonry is the pale, weathered limestone (“Cotswold stone”) typical of central Oxford.  \n3. “Logic Lane” is a very short, historic cobbled passage running through University College, linking the High Street to Merton Street in the heart of Oxford (OX1 4EX) ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Lane?utm_source=openai)).  \n4. The lane is private (college‐owned), with a small covered bridge at the High Street end, matching the wiring, masonry and sign placement visible in the photo ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Lane_covered_bridge?utm_source=openai))."
