The museum is in the Old Town area, specifically around Chambers Street. Although I considered neighborhoods like Cowgate or New Town, I realize New Town is actually to the north. The area I’m identifying is Old Town, Edinburgh, Scotland, and for a street-level neighborhood, I can simply say \"Old Town, Edinburgh\". The view features the unique yellow gorse and rolling hills."

        "content": "I’m analyzing the landscape: the flat-topped Salisbury Crags on the right and the rounded Arthur's Seat on the left. The architecture includes grey sandstone tenements, typical of the Old Town from the 18th-19th centuries. The colorful mid-terrace houses and the tent-like Dynamic Earth visitor center add character too. Based on the clues about the vantage point, it seems the view is from the National Museum of Scotland’s rooftop. For a precise neighborhood, I’ll conclude with “Old Town, Edinburgh, Scotland.”"

The basalt cliffs and rounded summit  \n   - We see a sheer, flat-topped escarpment rising steeply (on the right) with a rounded peak behind (on the left), both covered in gorse (yellow-flowering Ulex).  \n   - This exact combination of cliff plus dome is the Salisbury Crags (right) and Arthur’s Seat (left), part of Holyrood Park, immediately south-east of Edinburgh’s city centre.\n\n2. The white tensile-canopy structure at the cliff’s base  \n   - That pavilion-like building is Dynamic Earth, a science visitor centre with a distinctive white fabric roof and masts, located on Holyrood Road just under the Salisbury Crags.\n\n3. The townscape and rooflines in the foreground  \n   - Grey sandstone tenements, slate roofs, chimney stacks and narrow streets—classic Edinburgh Old Town architecture.  \n   - The vantage point is elevated, looking south-east across Chambers Street and the Lawnmarket area toward Holyrood Park."
