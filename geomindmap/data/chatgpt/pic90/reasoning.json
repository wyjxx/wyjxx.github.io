Next to it is a modern brutalist building, and there’s a notable bronze sphere sculpture that looks like Arnaldo Pomodoro's \"Sfera con Sfera.\" This sculpture seems to match one at Trinity College Dublin, particularly in the Campanile area, which suggests the location might be in Dublin."

The sphere at Trinity College Dublin is positioned in front of the Berkeley Library, which has a modern appearance from the 1960s. However, the building on the left in the photo looks more ornate, making me question if it's really Trinity.\n\nThe Vatican has a similar sphere in classical surroundings but doesn’t match our setting. Other locations like the UN Headquarters and the National Gallery of Ireland don't fit either. I might want to explore the possibility of it being at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., which features a Pomodoro sculpture."

The West Sculpture Garden doesn't have a sphere, and the East Building has some of his work, but not the spheres. For official sculpture locations, I know they include the Vatican Museums, UN Headquarters, Trinity College Dublin, and the Hirshhorn Museum, among others.\n\nAt Trinity, the sphere is outside the Berkeley Library, which has a modern brutalist style. In the photo, the right side appears to match the library, while the left showcases an older Georgian building, typical of Trinity’s campus."

    "content": "I’ve gathered enough evidence to confirm that we’re talking about the Sphere Within Sphere at Trinity College Dublin. It’s located in Library Square, right next to the Berkeley Library and the Museum Building, which dates back to 1857. So, specifically, it’s in the South-East Inner City neighborhood of Dublin. More accurately, it’s on the Trinity College campus near College Green, close to the Temple Bar area, bounded by Pearse Street and College Green."

While \"Library Square, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland\" might work, a more specific description could be \"South-East Inner City, Dublin, Ireland, Europe,\" as referenced in guides. Additionally, \"Library Square, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Dublin, Ireland\" captures the precise address. I need to ensure I'm clear and accurate in relaying this information."

    "content": "I've gathered enough clues from the photo: the grey, overcast skies and wet ground indicate a temperate, rainy climate. This scene features the Sfera con Sfera sculpture at Trinity College Dublin, with the Museum Building on the left and the Berkeley Library on the right. The shiny granite paving leads me to identify the location precisely as Library Square, Trinity College Dublin. For neighborhood specificity, \"South-East Inner City\" works well too. Final answer: \"Library Square, Trinity College Dublin, South-East Inner City, Dublin, Ireland, Europe.\"First, the bronze sphere in the foreground is Arnaldo Pomodoro’s “Sfera con Sfera” (Sphere Within Sphere).  This particular variant sits directly outside the podium of the Berkeley Library at Trinity College Dublin, immediately adjacent to the Museum Building of 1857. ([visitdublin.com](https://www.visitdublin.com/sphere-within-sphere?utm_source=openai), [flickr.com](https://www.flickr.com/photos/infomatique/25516193007?utm_source=openai))\n\nSecond, the ornate grey‐granite, two‐storey building with arched windows and decorative rosettes visible behind the sphere is the Museum Building (completed 1857), one side of Trinity’s Library Square.  To the right is the stark, concrete‐paneled Berkeley Library, confirming this is Library Square on the Trinity College campus. ([onprem.tcd.ie](https://onprem.tcd.ie/library/exhibitions/directors-choice/sfera-con-sfera/?utm_source=openai))\n\nFinally, Trinity College, including Library Square, lies in Dublin’s South-East Inner City area, directly off College Green in Dublin 2.
