It’s important to highlight that this area is in central Toulouse, within the Haute-Garonne department in Occitanie, France. I’m noting the building's facade with red and white stripes, common to Toulouse, and the presence of French flags indicating it’s in France. This public square is a popular tourist spot, confirming it's part of the central historic district."

    "content": "Let’s identify and interpret the key clues:\n\n1. Building material and style  \n   - The long façade alternates deep-red brick with pale stone banding, a hallmark of Toulouse’s “ville rose” (pink city) architecture, where local terra-cotta brick is paired with limestone detailing.  \n   - The grand, classically-inspired design—Corinthian columns, rooftop statuary, and a central pediment—signals an important civic monument rather than a private palace.  \n\n2. Inscription and flags  \n   - Above the main entrance pediment is the Latin word “CAPITOLIVM,” directly pointing to a “Capitol” or city hall in the Roman sense.  \n   - Dozens of French tricolour flags line the balconies, confirming this is a French municipal building.\n\n3. Plaza layout  \n   - The broad, flat, paved square in front—the Place du Capitole—is a famous gathering spot in the heart of Toulouse.\n\nTaken together, these clues pinpoint the Hôtel de Ville (Capitole) in Toulouse, on the Place du Capitole, which sits in the Capitole quarter of central Toulouse."
