    "content": "1. **Building architecture**: The main building is a very distinctive stone structure with classical European architecture. It appears to be made of light-colored limestone or similar stone. The building has:\n- Two stories with symmetrical design\n- Arched windows with ornate stone decorative elements around them\n- Classical columns or pilasters between windows\n- Decorative circular medallions or rosettes on the facade\n- Four prominent chimneys on the roof\n- A classical cornice with detailed molding\n- The style appears to be Renaissance Revival or Neoclassical\n\n2. **Modern building**: On the right side, there's a modern building with clean lines and large glass windows, creating a stark contrast with the classical building.\n\n3. **Golden sphere sculpture**: In the foreground, there's a large metallic golden/bronze sphere with what appears to be a cut-out or opening revealing an intricate internal structure. This looks like a significant public art installation.\n\n4. **Paving and plaza**: The ground appears to be paved with large stone or concrete slabs, suggesting this is a formal plaza or courtyard area.\n\n5. **Landscaping**: I can see some trees and what appears to be well-maintained landscaping around the buildings."
