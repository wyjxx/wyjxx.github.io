This area is indeed larger than Annecy’s small valley, which is actually situated below the mountains leading to the Rhône valley.

So maybe I should look into lists of peninsulas around the lake instead, but I might not need that.\n\nAnalyzing the shape of the lake, I notice it’s shallow near the shore and has light turquoise water.
