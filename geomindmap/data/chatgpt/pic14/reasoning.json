The corner building has a sign that reads \"SCHELLLING SALON,\" although there seems to be a letter mismatch as the actual building signage likely has \"SCHELLING SALON.\" Below it, there's \"GASTSTÄTTE.\" I can see a \"Pizzeria\" nearby, but the text is unclear. The architecture looks typical for Munich, with a speed limit sign and other European traffic signs noted."

The bus shelter is typical of Munich, featuring a blue advertisement and a yellow \"H\" sign for Haltestelle, which means \"stop.\" \n\nIt seems I can refine the location to Schellingstraße and Barer Straße in the Maxvorstadt district of Munich. The conclusion should reflect this detail nicely: \"Schellingstraße 54 at the corner of Barer Straße, Maxvorstadt, Munich, Germany, Europe.\" I’ll make sure to cite the sources appropriately!Let’s piece together the clues:\n\n1. The corner pub carries the name “Schelling-Salon” (ground-floor signage) and “Gaststätte” above the door, matching the historic Viennese-style café “Schelling-Salon.”  \n2. German street signs (30 km/h zone, yield, no-parking emblem) and the yellow “H” bus/tram stop confirm a German city, with overhead trolley/tram wires.  \n3. A quick lookup shows “Schelling-Salon” is located at Schellingstraße 54, on the corner of Barer Straße in the Maxvorstadt district of Munich, Bavaria, Germany ([schelling-salon.de](https://www.schelling-salon.de/kontakt.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schelling-Salon?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  \n\nAll architectural style, transit stop branding, and the exact matching name/number clear it as:"
