I’m breaking it down step by step.\n\nThe first clue is the calçada portuguesa, a distinctive black and white mosaic that's typical of Lisbon. The next clue is the tall white column, which is the D. Pedro IV column. Then the National Theatre D. Maria II behind it, recognizable by its portico and columns. I’m also noticing the surrounding Pombaline architecture and gentle hills. It feels like I’ve effectively narrowed it down!"
