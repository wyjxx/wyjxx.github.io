The Mediterranean style of the buildings, with their stucco walls and terracotta roofs, gives me a strong starting point. This suggests areas in Southern Europe. From there, I can narrow the search."

The French flag, coupled with the distinct architecture (terracotta roofs and stucco walls), and the presence of a seagull, strongly suggests a location along the French Riviera. The hillside topography and the clustered buildings confirm this. Next step: explore maps for a match."

My primary tool now is Google Images, where I am trying different search terms, and refining my results. I will cross-reference what I find on Google Images with Google Street View."
