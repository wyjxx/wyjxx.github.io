I'm prioritizing locations with grand stations from the specified era, a glass ceiling, and a German drugstore. The presence of a German brand significantly strengthens the case for Germany."

The dominance of German brands, like Rossmann, \"Asia Hung\", and the partial \"leckere Sachen\" sign, strongly points to Germany. The architectural style, however, is seen in many countries during that period. However, the architectural style is very characteristic of Germany. I'm looking to confirm a specific station, given the glass ceiling and ironwork."

I'm using the presence of \"ROSSMANN\" and \"Le Crobag\" as key indicators. I'll look at photographs and explore any documented renovations, as some stations have been modernized, potentially obscuring the features visible in the image. Given the strong German presence, I am now looking into Hamburg or Leipzig as the most likely candidates."
