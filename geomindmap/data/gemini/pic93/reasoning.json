The park and red-brick building give me a clue of a modern urban setting, although the style itself does not help as much in the UK as in other countries. I'm focusing on cataloging my architectural details against a database of well-known Gothic structures."

The architecture, down to the tower's battlements and spire, lines up. The layout and the park setting in front of the cathedral are also a good fit.
