There's a dry-stone wall made of limestone rocks, with low shrubs and yellow flowers that could be Cape sorrel. I also spot a rectangular building with a flat roof, and in the distance, a larger structure that resembles a fort or castle. Overall, the environment suggests a Mediterranean climate with typical vegetation and infrastructure."

    "title": "Evaluating the location",
    "content": "I'm trying to determine the location based on the dry-stone wall style, which reminds me of places like Gozo, Malta, or even parts of Cyprus and Italy. The yellow flowers and rocky fields are typical in Malta too. The distant building could be Verdala Palace, a 16th-century structure in Buskett Gardens. The pale beige limestone walls, narrow asphalt roads, and cylindrical water tanks on rooftops match the characteristics of Maltese architecture. I see a castle-like structure, with small corner turrets, possibly confirming it as Verdala. I might look up images of Verdala Palace for further validation."

I’ll check Google Street View to find the right visuals, although integrating maps could be tricky. I’m analyzing clues: dry stone walls, flat-roof houses with water heaters, flat farmland with shrubs, and symmetrical towers in the distance, likely Verdala Palace. So, the location seems to be near Verdala Palace in southwestern Malta, specifically around Buskett Gardens."
