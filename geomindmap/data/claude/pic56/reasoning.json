The site appears to be the historic windmill complex on Cerro Calderico, overlooking Consuegra in Toledo province. These windmills are a quintessential landmark of the La Mancha region, immortalized in Cervantes' Don Quixote. I'll investigate further to confirm the exact details of this picturesque setting.Cerro Calderico, Consuegra, Toledo, Spain, Europe"
