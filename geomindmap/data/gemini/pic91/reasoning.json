I'm focusing on the names, Mary P. Clancy and STEPH..., as they may be clues to the library's identity or patrons. Next, I'll look up these names and the Latin text to identify the precise location."

The architecture, the bookshelves, and even the busts match the description, and especially the appearance of a sphere of the Earth, \"Gaia\" by Luke Jerram. The clues align. Next, I am going to verify the name \"Mary P. Clancy\" in connection to Trinity. I can search for donors or historical figures with that name who have connection with Trinity College."
