    "content": "**Key observations:**\nThis is clearly a Roman aqueduct, and it's very well preserved. The most famous and well-preserved Roman aqueducts that are still standing and have this double-tiered design are:\n\n1. **Pont du Gard** in southern France - but this is more isolated and spans a river\n2. **Aqueduct of Segovia** in Spain - this matches very well with what I'm seeing\n3. Various aqueducts in Italy, but most are not as well preserved or don't have this urban setting\n\nThe Aqueduct of Segovia is famous for being in the middle of the city, with modern buildings around it, and has this exact double-tiered design. It's located in the Plaza del Azoguejo in Segovia, Spain.\n\nLet me verify this matches:\n- Double-tiered Roman arches: ✓\n- Light-colored stone (granite): ✓\n- Urban setting with modern buildings: ✓\n- Plaza/square setting: ✓\n- Clear Spanish Mediterranean climate: ✓"
