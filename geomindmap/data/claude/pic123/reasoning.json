The Smurfs connection is interesting - the Smurfs were created by Belgian cartoonist Peyo (Pierre Culliford), and Belgium has strong cultural ties with France and uses French as one of its official languages.\n\nThe presence of a Smurf-themed restaurant/brasserie could suggest:\n1. A location in France\n2. A location in Belgium (where Smurfs originated)\n3. A Smurf-themed attraction or park"

The blue mascot and sophisticated interior suggest this isn't just a random restaurant, but a carefully curated experience tied to the Smurfs' cultural heritage.Laeken, Brussels, Belgium, Europe"
