The neoclassical architectural elements, the \"CAPITOLIUM\" inscription (which is very helpful), and the French flags provide significant context. Further, the European Union flag and the style of dress of the people indicate a modern European setting, specifically, in France. The sky and shadows suggest a sunny, possibly summer day."

The match is undeniable."
