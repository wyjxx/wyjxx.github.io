So, my final conclusion is that this intersection is Koreastraße and Hongkongstraße in HafenCity, Hamburg, Germany. After double-checking on the map, I'm confident in this. For clarity, the precise location is Koreastraße, HafenCity, Hamburg, Germany, but I can confirm it as the intersection of Koreastraße and Hongkongstraße in HafenCity.\n\nLet’s pick out and interpret the key clues:\n\n1. The street‐name signs are in German, using the “ß” character (Straße), pointing toward Germany.  \n2. The two streets named are Koreastraße and Hongkongstraße.  \n3. On the building in the background is a sign above the garage entrance reading “Tiefgarage Hauptzollamt Hamburg” (i.e. the customs authority’s underground parking), explicitly naming Hamburg.  \n\nHamburg’s HafenCity district features a cluster of new streets named after world ports and Asian cities (e.g. Hongkongstraße, Shanghaiallee, Singapurstraße, Koreastraße). The intersection of Koreastraße and Hongkongstraße lies squarely within HafenCity, just outside the Hauptzollamt building."
