"content": "I'm trying to visually parse the photo of an airport interior. I see a seating area with a wooden curved bench and a tree, along with a yellow sign that may say \"Bromma Airport\" from Stockholm. This airport has a tiny, unique design, featuring a steel truss roof and wooden benches with trees. The user is looking for a neighborhood within the city, which I think could be Mariehäll, as Bromma is a borough within the district of Ulvsunda."
