My search terms are now more refined to find a specific city."

Then, I will be checking for streets named after the person. I'm also starting to explore possible neighborhoods, which should hopefully narrow it down further. The red and white building is a unique element I'll be focusing on as well."

I'm now cross-referencing the remaining image details against this hypothesis. The red and white building is especially critical in determining its validity. I'm checking architectural features of Mainz to see if they match the image details."

The bus stop, \"Fischtor,\" the traffic light pole, and the distinctive view of the overpass match perfectly. The red and white building is indeed St. Quintin's Church. It's confirmed: I have identified the image location!"
