    "content": "1. Man-made signage and language  \n   - A red “SNCF” logo, the national French railway operator.  \n   - Above the entrance, part of the legend reads “GARE DE NI…CE VILLE.”  \n   ⇒ This is a principal SNCF train station in France, named “Gare de Nice-Ville.” ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice-Ville_station?utm_source=openai))\n\n2. Architectural style and flag  \n   - A classic late 19th-century stone façade with sculpted ornamentation, a central clock, and mansard roof—typical of Louis-XIII-style French railway stations built by PLM.  \n   - A French tricolor flag flying atop the central pediment.  \n   ⇒ Confirms a historic, officially owned SNCF station building in France. ([fr.wikipedia.org](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gare_de_Nice-Ville?utm_source=openai))\n\n3. Published location data  \n   - English Wikipedia gives the address as “Avenue Thiers, 06008 Nice” for Gare de Nice-Ville. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice-Ville_station?utm_source=openai))  \n   - French Wikipedia specifies that Gare de Nice-Ville is situated in the Thiers quarter (quartier Thiers) of Nice. ([fr.wikipedia.org](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gare_de_Nice-Ville?utm_source=openai))\n\nNo other major SNCF stations in Nice match these exact architectural and naming details. Once the city is established as Nice, the only administratively defined neighborhood for this principal station is Thiers."
