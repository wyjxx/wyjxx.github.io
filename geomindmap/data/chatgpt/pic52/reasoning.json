    "content": "The user wants a street name sign for Calle de la Victoria, along with a small plaque mentioning Fray Matías de Irala. It's important to pinpoint the location, which I believe is likely in Madrid, specifically near Puerta del Sol. I think Calle de la Victoria runs between Plaza del Callao and Plaza de Isabel II, in the Centro neighborhood. I’ll need to verify this by searching for “Calle de la Victoria Madrid” to confirm the details."

    "title": "Identifying Calle de la Victoria",
    "content": "I'm confirming that Calle de la Victoria is located in Madrid, specifically in the Madrid de los Austrias neighborhood, within the Centro district. It’s a narrow street running from Carrera de San Jerónimo to Calle de la Cruz. The plaque I noticed references Fray Matías de Irala, and mentions \"En este lugar de la victoria municipal.\" The street sign \"CALLE DE LA VICTORIA\" suggests it's an official city sign, featuring a royal crest and laurel wreath, which adds authenticity."

    "title": "Describing Calle de la Victoria",
    "content": "I'm noting that the street signage in Madrid typically features white backgrounds with blue borders, but in the older neighborhoods like Madrid de los Austrias, ceramic signs in cream with black text are used. The sign for \"Calle de la Victoria\" likely has an image of a saint within a laurel wreath. The building style matches granite and wrought-iron balconies common in the old center of Madrid. Therefore, the precise location is Calle de la Victoria, Barrio de Sol, Madrid, Spain, in Europe. I’ll find and reference the relevant Wikipedia page for accuracy."
