The crow-stepped gables are less common in France, so I'll need to cross-reference these features with French castles. I'll focus on castles with a history of tourism and those accessible to visitors."

I'm refining my search terms to include \"Carcassonne crow stepped gables\" and \"Carcassonne gatehouse architecture\" to specifically target those unique elements. If Carcassonne doesn't match precisely, I'll broaden my search to include other fortified cities and castles in France with similar features, focusing on accessibility information."
