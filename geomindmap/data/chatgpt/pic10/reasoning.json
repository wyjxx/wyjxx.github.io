    "content": "I’m looking closely at the Cologne crest, which has three crowns and eleven flames, but I wonder if this could relate to Bonn, which has a simpler design with a white bar on red. I notice a sign saying \"Mehlgasse,\" indicating it's a pedestrian zone in Germany, and it mentions delivery times. There's also a tapas bar named \"La Guarida,\" which translates to \"the hideout\" in Spanish. Additionally, there's a sign for a café/bar, and a tattoo parlor nearby."

    "title": "Investigating Mehlgasse location",
    "content": "I see a \"Tattoo\" sign under a green vine along a narrow medieval street, with cobblestones typical of old German towns. At the far end, there's a large church facade that might be Martinskirche, but I'm not entirely sure. \"Mehlgasse\" sounds familiar; I think it might be a street in the medieval part of a town, possibly Bonn. However, I’m unsure if Mehlgasse is there or in places like Freiburg or Cologne. I should search to clarify its location in Germany."

    "title": "Analyzing signage in Germany",
    "content": "I’m considering the signage in Germany, particularly regarding pedestrian zones. The pedestrian zone sign often includes the city crest. Many municipalities incorporate their crest into street name signs too. I wonder if the crest has a red top half and a white bottom or if it's the other way around. It seems that the sign I’m looking at features the coat of arms at the top, followed by the street name “Mehlgasse.” Below that, there's a separate sign indicating the pedestrian zone with time restrictions."

    "title": "Determining Mehlgasse Location",
    "content": "I’m looking into the street Mehlgasse in Koblenz’s Altstadt. The information from StreetDir indicates it’s a pedestrian zone with a length of 121 meters. I gather clues about its signage, like the German language and business names like \"Guarida\" for a restaurant located there. The cobblestone streets and half-timbered buildings show typical architecture of the region. My conclusion is: Mehlgasse, Altstadt, Koblenz, Germany, Europe."
